# HTDF

- [English](./README.md)

## Introduction
HTDF is a high-performance public blockchain developed by HTDF Foundation. It is based on [ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) & [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) on [tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)  . We merged tendermint's consensus, cosmos-sdk's application logic, and ethereum's account system & smart contract architecture into a brand new architecture - htdf blockchain.
